<h1>What is a hackathon?</h1>
<p>
A hackathon is an event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development 
collaborate intensively on projects. Hackathons typically last between a day and a week. They are usually
intended for educational and social purposes. However, in many cases, the goal is to create usable software.
</p>
<h1>What are the different types of hackathons?</h1>
<p>
There are many different types of hackathons. Hackathons tend to have a specific focus.
Their focus can be on a specific programming language, operating system, application, API,
or the demographci group of the programmers. In some cases, there is no restriction on the type
of software hackers can create.

<h1>What are some cool hackathons?</h1>
<p>
There's an extremely large and growing amount of hackathons being hosted by
all kinds of organizations. Here are a few of them:<br/>
<a>MHacks</a><br/>
Hosted by University of Michigan.<br/>
<a>LAHacks</a><br/>
Hosted by University of California, Los Angeles.<br/>
These hackathons bring in over 1000 people and put them in a big stadium,
making it easier to walk around and make connections. People are able to
feed off of each other's energy. However, a problem with these hackathons is that
they often experience trouble with food/power/wifi due to the large scale.<br/>

<a>PennApps: </a>
Hosted by University of Pennsylvania.<br/>
<a>Hack MIT: </a>
Hosted by MIT.<br/>
<a>Hack NY: </a>
Hosted by Columbia and NYU.<br/>
<a>YC Hacks: </a><br/>
Hosted by Y Combinator (Early Stage startup incubator based in Mountain View).<br/>
These 4 hackathons are known for drawing the best of the best. Participants likely
have attended several hackathons before. Getting into any of these hackathons is considered
a big deal in the world of tech and is something that attendees will highlight on their resumes.<br/>
