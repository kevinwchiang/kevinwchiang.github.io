<h1>What is a hackathon?</h1>
<p>
A hackathon is an event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development 
collaborate intensively on projects. Hackathons typically last between a day and a week. They are usually
intended for educational and social purposes. However, in many cases, the goal is to create usable software.
