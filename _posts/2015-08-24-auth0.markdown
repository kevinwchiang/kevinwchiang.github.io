<p>I was recently attempting to add Auth0 to a <a href='http://homerow-zeus.herokuapp.com'>game</a> that I was working on,
and ran into some outdated documentation. This blog post is intended to be a guide
on how to set up Google+ on Auth0 when encountering the following issue on log in:</p>
<img src='/img/auth0-error.png'>

<p>1. Go to the <a href='https://console.developers.google.com'>Google Developers Console</a> and create a project with your project name</p>

<p>2. Click on APIs on the left side bar and navigate to Social APIs - Google+ API, and enable the API</p>

<p>3. Click on Credentials on the left side bar and navigate to the OAuth consent screen tab to enter and save your product info</p>

<p>4. Navigate back to the Credentials tab, click Add credential, and click on OAuth 2.0 client ID in the dropdown</p>

<p>5. After selecting the type of application for your project, you will have successfully created your client ID. Click into
the created client ID link to view your ID and secret. Add your auth0 domain 
to the Authorized JavaScript origins field and your auth0 callback URL to
the Authorized redirect URIs field</p>

<p>6. The hard part is over! Copy down the client ID and secret and navigate to your
<a href='http://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/social'>Auth0 social connections</a> to toggle Google on</p>
<img src='/img/toggleon.png'>

<p>7. After it's toggled on, click on it to access its properties and enter the Client ID and Client Secret in the
appropriate space</p>

<p>8. You may want to go to your Apps/APIs tab under the Auth0 dashboard to ensure that you
are allowing the right callback URLs. Remember to include your local host, auth0 callback URL, 
and deployed URL</p>

<p>You should be able to sign up and log in through Auth0 using any Google+ account now!</p>
