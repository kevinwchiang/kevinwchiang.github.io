<p>My first post ever! The past couple of days, I've been working on creating a game using D3 for the first time. The game that my partner and I were trying to create is much like Collider, if you've ever heard of it. Prior to being exposed to D3, I had only tried using jQuery to manipulate DOM objects. Going through this project really helped me see some of the versatility and power that D3 provides. </p>

<p>Let's jump into the problem! In our project, we had to make SVG images which we set to look like asteroids. First, we created the SVG using D3: </p>

<code class= "highlight">var svg = d3.select('body')
.append('svg')
.attr("width", 1000)
.attr("height", 625)
.style("border", "1px solid white");</code>

<p>We wanted these asteroids to be able to spin using CSS. After several Google searches, we could only find CSS webkits and solutions that would make our SVG images rotate. To be continued...</p>
